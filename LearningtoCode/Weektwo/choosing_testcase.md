# Choosing Test Case
When chooosing test cases for your function you need to consider the following:

- **Size**
For collections, test with an empty collection, a collection with 1 item, the smallest interesting case, and a collection with several items.

- **Dichotomies**
Vowels/non-vowels, even/odd, positive/negative, empty/full, and so on.

- **Boundaries**
If the function behaves differently for values near a particular threshold, test at that threshold.

- **Order**
If a function behaves differently when the values are in different orders, identify and test each of those orders.
