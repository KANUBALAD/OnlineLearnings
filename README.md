Welcome to the **OnlineLearnings** repository! This space is dedicated to our exploration and mastery of various concepts in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Generative AI. Here, we will document our learning journey, share valuable resources, and showcase projects that highlight our growth in this dynamic field.

## Overview

In this repository, you will find:
- **Course Resources:** A curated list of online courses from platforms such as Coursera, EDX, and other educational platforms. We believe in continuous learning, and this section will serve to provide a list of the courses we have completed or are currently taking.
  
- **NLP_GenAI Folder:** 
  - This dedicated folder will host our collaborative work on NLP articles and projects. 
  - Contributions will be made by [Charlotte Olivia Namagembe](mailto:charl2olivia@gmail.com) and myself, focusing on both theoretical concepts and practical applications in NLP and Generative AI.

## Our Mission
